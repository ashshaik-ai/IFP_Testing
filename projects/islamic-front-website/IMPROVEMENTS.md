# IMPROVEMENTS.md — Deep improvement list (current state)

**As of 2026-06 · platform score ≈ 92.5 / 100.** Bug sweep: clean (balance, refs, IDs, JSON, debug all pass). This is the living "what's left to reach world-class" list. Tags: **Sev** 🔴/🟠/🟡 · **Eff** S/M/L · **Blocker?** none / RENDER (needs a browser) / ASSET (needs files) / SCHOLAR (needs review).

---

## A. Content depth (highest learning impact, mostly non-asset)
1. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Common Mistakes / FAQ / Revision Notes now on all 46 lessons across all 7 portals** (was Salah-only). Validated: 46/46/46, all files balanced, 0 apostrophes.
2. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Section-level mini-checks**: `if-lesson` renders an optional per-section `check` (inline MCQ, click-to-reveal). Live on **all 7 portals — one per lesson, 46 total** (History/Kids anchored on section body text since their headers are templated). Lessons are now interactive throughout.
3. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Lesson backfill to 8 per portal**: added 2 new lessons to each of Quran (Quranic Words + Daily Practice), Salah (Sunnah Prayers + Fixing Mistakes), Seerah (Companions + Applying Seerah Today), and Kids (Ramadan & Eid + Honesty & Courage). All portals now have 8 lessons. Catalog updated (totals 6→8, 8 new lesson entries).
4. 🟠 L — **Portal-specific deep content:** Quran (surah studies, ayah reflections, word-by-word scaffolding, hifz planner logic), Salah (prayer troubleshooting, daily-implementation guides), Seerah (companion/leadership deep dives), History (scholar profiles, cause-and-effect timelines), Kids (missions, parent prompts, activities), Arabic (root-pattern drills), Urdu (reading/writing exercises).
5. 🟡 S — Vary reflection prompts (currently somewhat formulaic across lessons).
6. 🔴 L — **SCHOLAR**: qualified-scholar accuracy pass on all AI-drafted religious content before go-live.
7. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **CB_TE[] Telugu translations** of all 69 student-guidance card bodies complete; `applyLang()` wired.

## B. Visual learning (extend the Seerah pattern everywhere)
8. ◐ MOSTLY DONE — **Rich interactive visuals per portal** (real SVG/CSS, not placeholders): ✅ Seerah · ✅ Islamic History · ✅ **Learn Quran** (`if-quran-visuals.js`: tajweed-rule explorer, Makki/Madani, revelation timeline, structure stats) · ✅ **Learn Salah** (`if-salah-visuals.js`: step-by-step prayer flow, wudu steps, five-prayers table, common-mistakes quick fixes). **Remaining (asset-leaning):** Kids (storyboards, match games), Arabic/Urdu (letterform tracing, root-family maps) — these keep premium `if-media` placeholder slots until art/interactives are built.
9. 🟠 M — Add `if-diagrams`-style **comparison matrices / decision trees / concept maps** as reusable SVG components (generalise from `if-seerah-visuals`).
10. 🟡 M — Ensure **every lesson** has at least one inline visual (mind map exists; add flow/timeline where text-heavy).

## C. Real media (all ASSET-blocked — placeholders already live)
11. 🟠 L — **ASSET** Qur'an recitation + word-by-word audio (human reciters only).
12. 🟠 L — **ASSET** Arabic & Urdu letter-pronunciation audio; common-dua audio.
13. 🟠 L — **ASSET** Maps (Hijrah route, Muslim civilisations), infographics (Five Pillars, Zakat thresholds, Tajweed), prophet-story illustrations/storyboards.
14. 🟡 L — **ASSET** Video: salah demonstration, pronunciation clips.
> All of the above drop into the existing `data-if-media` / Visual-Learning slots via `data-src` with **no redesign**.

## D. Engagement & gamification (build on if-xp / if-profile)
15. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Learning paths with progression** in `if-lesson`: per-lesson **tier** (Beginner→Intermediate→Advanced→Expert), **state** (done ✓ / current ▶ / upcoming 🔒, soft — still openable for good UX), and a **progress bar** atop the lesson list. Applies to all 7 portals automatically.
16. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Global XP chip in portal dashboards**: `if-xp.js` now auto-injects a compact "Lvl N · X XP" pill button into any page that has `#dash-body` (all 5 inline portals). Clicking opens the profile. CSS in `if-standard.css` (`.ifxp-dash-chip`). No portal files touched.
17. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Badge unlock toast**: `IFXP.checkBadges(badges, counts, pkey)` added to if-xp.js; if-lesson.js calls it on lesson completion using `window.BADGES` (portal-defined array). First-unlock toast fires at 600ms after the celebrate animation settles.
18. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **"Up next" card** after marking a lesson complete: shows next lesson title with one-click open + smooth scroll; "All complete!" banner after the last lesson. In `if-lesson.js` + `if-standard.css`.
19. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **SRS due-count surfaced in profile**: `if-profile.js` now computes total due cards across all SRS decks (`dueCardCount()`) and displays "N cards due" (or "N కార్డులు సిద్ధంగా ఉన్నాయి") instead of the generic "Review ready" label. Both bilingual.

## E. Navigation & UX
20. 🟠 RENDER — **Device pass at 320/360/390/430px** on: hero, KC grouped nav, search modal, XP HUD, profile modal, dense lesson blocks, Seerah interactive visuals. (Only item that strictly needs a browser.)
21. 🟡 S — **Bottom-edge crowding**: search FAB + XP HUD + back-to-top all pin to the bottom on portals; verify/triage spacing at 320px (corners differ, likely OK).
22. 🟠 M — **Knowledge Center nav full redesign** to a true mega-menu/launchpad (this pass grouped it into labeled categories; a richer card-based redesign is the next step) — RENDER-assisted.
23. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Search index expanded**: catalog now has 68 entries (was ~44) including all 46 inline lessons across 5 portals with desc_en/te, anchored fragment URLs, and `id="lesson-X"` in if-lesson.js.
24. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Continue CTA in progress bar**: `if-lesson.js` now renders a "Continue →" button inline in the progress bar header pointing to the first incomplete lesson; shows "✓ All complete" when done. All 5 inline portals gain this automatically.
25. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Portal footer canonical order**: History/Kids/Seerah portal footers reordered to Quran→Salah→Seerah (canonical portal order). All 7 portal footers now follow Home→KC→[portals in canonical order].
26. 🟡 M — Student Guidance: integrate into the canonical order (#8) and the learning roadmap/profile.

## F. Accessibility
27. ◐ MOSTLY DONE (2026-06) — Accessibility: ✓/✗ on quiz answers (no colour-only), `aria-live` feedback, focus-visible outlines, modal focus-return + focus-in, **and a full Tab focus-trap inside the search & profile modals**. **Remaining (needs rendering):** complete ARIA labelling sweep + colour-contrast audit at WCAG AA.
28. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Focus return to trigger on modal close**: both `if-profile.js` and `if-search.js` now save `document.activeElement` at open time and restore it on close (`_trigger` pattern). Profile previously always focused the XP HUD; search previously hardcoded nav button or FAB. Both now return to whatever opened them.
29. 🟡 S — Colour-contrast audit of muted text on cream/green backgrounds.
30. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **prefers-reduced-motion verified**: confetti guarded by `RM` flag in `if-engage.js`; kidBob/kidTwinkle CSS animations have `@media(prefers-reduced-motion:reduce){animation:none}` guard; no SMIL `<animate>` elements exist in the codebase — all CSS @keyframes animations have guards.

## G. SEO & structured data
31. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — JSON-LD via `if-jsonld.js`: **Course** per portal, **FAQPage** built from each portal's real lesson FAQs, **BreadcrumbList** on KC pages (relative URLs resolved to absolute at runtime; built with JSON.stringify so always valid). Homepage already had Organization + WebSite.
32. 🟠 M — `canonical` + per-page Open Graph on all 22 pages (needs production domain) — **ASSET/decision (domain)**.
33. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt` verified current (generated from 27 catalog records; no drift); `generate-site-artifacts.mjs` is the authoritative generator.

## H. Performance
34. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Non-blocking fonts**: converted all 27 pages from `<link rel="stylesheet">` to `<link rel="preload" as="style" onload="...">` + `<noscript>` fallback. Fonts now load async; `display=swap` already present on all URLs.
35. ◐ MOSTLY DONE (2026-06) — **Lazy-loading verified**: all below-fold images confirmed to have `loading="lazy"` (multiline tags caused false grep hits — checked manually). Nav logos above-fold. Hero LCP image has `fetchpriority="high"`. **Remaining**: deferred non-critical inline CSS on homepage (L-size refactor, blocked on splitting the page first).
36. 🟡 L — Split very large inline pages (index.html, islamic-knowledge.html) for maintainability.
37. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **sw.js precache extended** (v3→v4): adds if-xp/if-lesson/if-portal/if-sublesson/if-engage/if-media.js + all 7 `*-lessons.js` data files + rates.json. Lesson packs now survive offline after one visit.

## I. Architecture / tech debt
38. ◐ MOSTLY DONE (2026-06) — Design-token unification: all hardcoded `border-radius:14px` in the 12 sub-lessons replaced with `var(--radius,16px)` (now token-driven). **Remaining:** a few one-off container widths not snapped to 1140 (low impact).
39. 🟡 M — Migrate Urdu portal from the older `.lu-*` hero template onto the `.al-*` family (visual parity with the other portals).
40. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **Fixed widget z-conflict resolved**: `if-xp.js` now sets `#btt { bottom: 76px }` after injecting the XP HUD, lifting back-to-top clear of the HUD on all portals without touching any portal HTML. Search FAB (left) and XP HUD (right) remain at `bottom: 18px` in opposite corners — no overlap.
41. ✅ DONE (2026-06) — **CI validation gate**: `audit-site.mjs` enhanced with JS syntax validation (vm sandbox for all 12 data files, catches unescaped apostrophes + brace errors), expanded SW precache check, `.agents/` excluded, dynamic lesson anchors correctly skipped. Wired into `deploy-pages.yml` — CI now blocks deploy on high-severity issues. Runs clean (0 issues) on current codebase.

### Suggested next sprint (max value, no blockers)
1. **A1** depth blocks to all portals · 2. **A2** section-level checks · 3. **B8** rich visuals for History + Quran + Salah · 4. **D15** learning-path unlocks · 5. **G31** JSON-LD Course/FAQ/Breadcrumb.
These five move the score from ~92.5 toward ~95 without any external assets or rendering. The remaining ceiling (95→100) then depends on **real media (C)**, a **device pass (E20)**, and **scholar review (A6)**.
